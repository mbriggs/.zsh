        <h1>ZSH Config</h1>

<p>This is my zsh config, which was mostly created by reading others on
the web, and stealing ideas.</p>

<p>If you live in your prompt all day for your job, then using a
"framework" like oh-my-zsh is only going to hurt you in the long run
(like janus for vim, or emacs-starter-kit for emacs). Instead of
looking at this like a "framework", treat it as either inspiration for
something totally yours, or a starting point that you extend and
modify to suit your personal preferences</p>

<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<p>I'll try to address this at some point, but I have a seprate repo for my dotfiles, and there are some parts of this that will source those files. So before an install, have dot files that look something like <a href="https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/scmbrc">https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/scmbrc</a> <a href="https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/git.scmbrc">https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/git.scmbrc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/aliases">https://github.com/mbriggs/dotfiles/blob/master/aliases</a> (to be clear, that means something like git.scmbrc should be in your home dir with a dot in front of it, <code>.git.scmbrc</code>)</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<pre><code>cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mbriggs/.zsh
cd .zsh
make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>This has a lot of common configurations and customizations. What is
not so common is that it is also split apart into very easy to manage
files, and has a one command install <code>make install</code>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, here are some highlights that aren't quite as common.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hchbaw/auto-fu.zsh">auto-fu</a> is an amazing
plugin that provides fast completion as you type. The only downside
is that it is a pain to set up, but once it is, this plugin probably
will have the greatest impact on your day to day usage.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze">scm breeze</a> is another
amazing plugin that makes git a lot less painful to use from the
command line, especially if you are on a project where people love
to use super long branch names with silly word separaters (like
<code>_</code>), AND there are several hundred branches in the repo.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure">Pure</a> prompt (by
cindersaurus) is beautiful, minimal, and very fast (uses the fastest
method of git dirty checking possible)</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby has a packaging system called Bundler, which requires you to
prepend certain commands with <code>bundle exec</code>. This gets old very
fast, and there are various solutions available out there. This
solution has a whitelist of commands that will be automatically
<code>bundle exec</code>d, but only if you are in a project that uses bundler</p></li>
<li><p><code>B</code> refers to the current branch in git. So if you are on a branch
called <code>this-is-some-really-really-long-branch-name</code>, then <code>git push
origin B</code> is extremely helpful.</p></li>
</ul>
